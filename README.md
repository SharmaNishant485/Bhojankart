This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

<p>BhojanKart is a food delivery app that I'am building as a learning project to explore Flutter and improve my mobile app devloopment skills. The concept is based on connecting users with affordable, home-cooked meals from local vendors and tiffin services.</p>
